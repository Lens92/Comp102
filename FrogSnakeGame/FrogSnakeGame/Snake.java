/** The snake is created at a random position with a random 360 degree direction.
 * The constructor does not have any parameters.
 * It can move
 *  - makes it go forward one step in its current direction.
 *  - if outside arena boundaries, makes it go backward one step, and
 *         then turn to a new (random) direction.
 *  The walls of the arena are determined by the constants:
 *    ARENA_SIZE, TOP_WALL, BOT_WALL, LEFT_WALL and RIGHT_WALL
 * It can report its current position (x and y) with the
 *  getX() and getY() methods.
 *  move() will make it move in the direction it is going. 
 *  draw() will make it draw itself (image size should be 30).
